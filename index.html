        <h6 style="padding-left: 27px; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">
          A kitchen holds so many appliances that function to different things. Let's say I want to reheat chicken, I could choose the microwave, oven, air fryer, and many other choices. The choice of the appliance is based on how we want the food to be made or reheated in, such as crispy, soft, hard, soggy. We want to remake the microwave to accommodate all of the different appliances into one.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our motivation to make a smart microwave was to decrease the amount of appliances in the kitchen to reduce the space they take up and also make using a microwave more efficient in today's world. With so many technological advances, we want to combine a lot of things we use in our daily lives, such as Alexa, to change the way our lives look in the kitchen.

        <h6 style="padding-left: 27px; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">
          Through our production of the smart microwave, we want to revolutinize what a kitchen will look like in the future. We want to deduce clutter, streamline cooking, and intergrate technologies we use every day. Through the use of smart devices like an smartphones and google homes, it will give people the ability to use a microwave from wherever they are. Like a mother heating up their children's food from work to not having to get out of bed in the morning to make breakfast, we will give people the ability to make cooking easier, add less oversight, and efficient.

          There have been progression in the microwave since it's creation to make it more "smart" and also other appliances such as an air fryer. A lot of the features we want to implement in the smart microwave doesn't exist yet in that capacity. One of the microwaves I have found is the

        <h6 style="padding-left: 27px; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">
          We have already created a cardboard prototype of our smart microwave. Some of the new ways we plan on making a more functional smart microwave is creating an upgraded physical model with and interegrating the technologies we want or making a virtual prototype to allow for a bigger range of possible functionalities.

          <strong>Website:</strong> <br>
          Intially, I, Sabrina Ahmed, wrote the website based on the initial requirements from the professor. After the team meeting, we were told what updates we need to make to our smart microwave and what was needed for the website. As the project progressed, I changed the website to better fit the final requirements with the details given from the profesor. I also added things along the way with the progression of the smart microwave.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Prototype:</strong> <br>
          When creating a smart microwave, there are so many aspects we want to add, but we have the inability to do so in a physical fashion under the timeline of the project and with out current knowledge. With that, we decided to take the route of creating a virtual prototype, after discussing with the professor. We also had a mock physical prototype from earlier in the semester when we made cardboard prototypes. In the middle of the project timeline, we learned how to use Sketchup. With that knowledge, we were able to make multiple prototype that showed the different features we wanted to incorporate into the smart microwave.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Video:</strong> <br>
          The video was the last thing we worked out. As a group, we made a document that outlined what we wanted to show in the video and break up the responsibilies. Some people took over voice over, creation of videos, and the editing of the video. This aspect of the development process system take a long time since we just needed to explain the prototype and we planned prior.

                With so many ideas and with the time frame of the project, we will have to narrow down which we want to choose. After narrowing down, we will also have to figure out which ones are doable for us to do at our scale and knowledge.

                With making a physical prototype, we can allow the possible users and viewers an easier way to understand all of the features that the smart microwave has. In the time frame and knowledge level, we aren't going to be able to make an actual working smart microwave.
                <br><br>
                If we opt for the virtual prototype, we can add more features that we would like, but it will be more time consuming creating the model and we also have a lack of knowledge of how to do virtual models. With that, it will also be time consuming to research and learn as we construct.

                Usually when you defrost something in the microwave, it tells you to input the weight of the food. We want to integrate that into the microwave. The issue we have found with the idea is that you have to weigh the dish and then add the food and weigh again. The microwave will have to do the math to find the weight difference. We will have to allow for some storage system for it to remember the last weight and do the calculations.

          <strong>-Week 1: May 31st to April 6th:</strong> Create the website and set details for project<br><br>
          This week we focused on the idea of the project. We decided on working on a smart microwave. We spent about an hour looking at our past miroboards about the topic. For the rest of the week, we were mainly deciding what features we wanted to add, remove, and change. While we were doing this, we made a google doc that was shared amongst the group for all for all of the edits. At mid-week, Sabrina started creating the foundations of the website. With the changes, Sabrina was able to add all the required fields to the website.
          <br><br><br>

          <strong>-Week 2: April 7th to April 13th:</strong> Start creating prototype<br><br>
          At the beginning of week two, we met with our professor, Mrs. Kim. We discussed our plans and she helped us with what item we need to tweek. After the discussion, we were able to start on the prototype. We decided on using a virtual prototype, along with having the cardboard physical prototype we produced earlier in the semester. We worked on our skills with using the software SketchUp for a class assignment. Using this knowledge, Rohit created the 3D prototype.
          <br><br><br>

          <strong>-Week 3: April 14th to April 20th: </strong>Finish prototype, fill out website with changes, and start filming video<br><br>
          During the third week, Rohit finished producing the virtual prototype of the smart microwave. After the conclusion of the prototype, we looked over it and decided if there were anything we forgot to implement. Then, we were able to start filming the clips for the video. We met together after class and was able to create a plan on a google doc for everyone's responsibilities in the video. Mihn was in charge of creating some clips and editing the video. Jack created clips and did some of the voiceovers. Rohit talked about the features of the microwave and videos some clips with the physical prototype. Sabrina produced some clips and updated the website. In the website update, we changed it to emulate the tweeks we made in the prior week and added places for the pictures and video.
          <br><br><br>
          <strong>-Week 4: April 21st to April 27th: </strong>Finish filming video and edit video, update website<br><br>
          In the final week, the group finished filming their clips for the video. As the clips were added to the shared google drive, Mihn was able to start putting the clips together and letting the other group members know if there were any holes in the video where we needed to add some clips for clarity. After the completion of the editing of the video, Mihn uploaded it to youtube and turned it in. Sabrina updated the website to add the pictures in the carousel placeholder she created the week before. The video and youtube link was also added to the top of the page.
